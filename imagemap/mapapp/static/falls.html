           Cup and Saucer fall is located in the Sathuvachari district of Vellore, this place is perfect for spending a quiet and serene holiday. 
           Ensconced by thick trees and bushes, the beauty it beholds is worth watching. 
           The name of this waterfall is attributed to its unique shape that appears as if a cup of water is pouring its contents into a massive saucer.

           The gorgeous site can be best enjoyed from atop the hill. To reach the top of the hill, take an exciting and adventurous trek through the lush green forests surrounding the fall
