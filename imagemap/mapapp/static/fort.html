            Vellore Fort is a large 16th-century fort in the center of Vellore city, 
            in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It was built by Vijayanagara kings. The fort was at one time the headquarters of the Aravidu Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire.
            The fort has grand ramparts and wide moat.

            The fort's ownership passed from Vijayanagara kings, to the Bijapur sultans, to the Marathas, 
            to the Carnatic Nawabs and finally to the British, who held the fort until India gained independence. 
            The Indian government maintains the fort with the Archaeological Department. During British rule, 
            the Tipu Sultan's family and the last king of Sri Lanka, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha were held as prisoners in the fort. 
            The fort houses the Jalakanteswarar Hindu temple, the Christian St. John's Church and a Muslim mosque, 
            of which the Jalakanteswarar Temple is famous for its magnificent carvings. The first significant military rebellion against 
            British rule erupted at this fort in 1806, and it is also a witness to the massacre of the Vijayanagara royal family of Sriranga Raya.
